First of all, a massive thank you to all of you for participating in this beta! üôè

TDCode has been a passion project of mine for the last month, and I'm incredibly proud of where it is now. I'm even more excited to take it to the next level with your help. Your feedback is crucial to improving TDCode, and I can't wait to see what you'll build with it.

This repo will be the **central hub** for everything related to this beta test, including:

- **Bug reports**
- **Feature requests**

While TDCode is already very functional, it is still in an evolving state. You should expect **bugs** and **significant changes** as we move forward. Your patience and input will help me polish this project into something truly amazing. Please feel free to report issues, suggest features, or give general feedback‚ÄîI'm eager to improve the experience.

> **Note:** I'm still learning and growing as a developer. While I'll do my best to ensure TDCode runs smoothly, some things may be rough around the edges. If you encounter issues, let me know, and I'll address them as quickly as possible.
