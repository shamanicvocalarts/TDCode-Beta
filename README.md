# Welcome to the TDCode-Beta!
this is the repo for the TDCode Beta. 
firstly I just want to say a massive thank you to all of you for participating in this beta! TDCode has been a passion project of mine for the last month, I'm really proud of where I have gotten this project to at this point, & I'm even more excited to take it to the next step with all of you. 

This repo will act as the central hub for all bug reports & feature requests during this Beta test season, as well as where I will inform all of you about any changes made to the project during the course of this season. TDCode, while being very functional, is far from feature complete, so expect bugs & large changes between releases. I am also far from the most experienced developer, it is my intention to make TDCode, & this Beta season, as well polished as possible, however if things are a bit rough around the edges, let me know, but please be patient with me & TDCode!

Between this video & the TDCode_MD_docs file, this should provide all the orientation you need for the project. let me know in feature requests if there is anything missing, as proper documentation & tutorials is also on the roadmap to be developed & improved during this testing period. skip to 28:28 if you just want to see the code editing features in action. 

Massive thanks again to all of you. Im really looking forward to getting TDCode into your hands, hearing your feedback & seeing what amazing things you all build with it 

Much Love
